# Introductory Video

> Use a short introductory video addressing the two claims.

[Intro - *montage of people voicing questions, increasingly overlapping*]

Questions. We all ask them. Usually we want them answered. The answers themselves can generate more questions. Sometimes the *answer* is a question. Questions. There seems to be no end.

I want to make a claim. Two claims, actually. And it has to do with questions. Before you ask me what they are, I want to point out that these are **claims**. I'm putting them forward as statements of **fact**. I expect them to be challenged (you would do well to examine any claim brought before you).

I'm making two claims. Look at them closely. These are facts. These are true. Think about them.

These claims are an answer. But these will lead to more questions. And you shouldn't stop until you are satisfied.

These claims are about one thing. They are about a question and its answer.

My first claim. I know what the most important question is. Do you? You should. The most important question is, "Is there a God?". That's the most important question.

Don't believe me? Think about it. If you knew the answer to *that* question, you would be well on your way to answering most of the questions in your life.

"Is there a God?" Or, phrased another way, "Does God Exist?" That's the most important question. How do I know? Simple, really. Whatever answer you land on to that question - "Yes" or "No" - will have a dramatic impact on the other important questions in life. Both personal, and common. Both abstract and concrete. A "No" or a "Yes" answer will shape the answers to almost every other question you might ask.

My first claim. The most important question before you is, "Does God Exist? Is there a God?"

My second claim regards the answer. Can we know the answer to this most important question? My claim is "Yes, we *can* know the answer."

You might be inclined to quibble with this claim. You might do so by putting the emphasis on the word "know". Some would argue that we can't really *know* the answer because there isn't enough evidence. Or they might say that because the question itself is so huge, so important, so life-shaping and life-transforming that any evidence would have to be immense, even overwhelming, in order to answer that most important question. I agree, in part.

If you're going to answer that most important question, you should have some evidence. Evidence that is accessible to you.

But there is evidence. And you can examine the evidence. How serious you are about the question will shape how serious you are about examining the evidence.

There is evidence. There is a lot of evidence to examine. Far too much evidence to begin to state here. That's why I'm so confident in my second claim. Yes, you *can* know the answer.

Notice something about my second claim. I'm not claiming (at this point) "Yes, there is a God" or "No there is no such thing as God". I'm simply claiming that you can arrive at an answer to that most important question: "Does God Exist? Is there a God?"

My second claim: Yes, we *can* answer know the answer to the question "Is there a God?" And that's where your journey begins. It's an invitation. Ask the question. Look for the answer. Examine the evidence for yourself.
